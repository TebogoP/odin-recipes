# Odin Recipes 🍽️

## Project Overview

This project is part of **The Odin Project – Foundations Course**. The goal is to practice core **HTML skills** by building a simple, multi-page recipe website.

The site consists of a main index page that links to individual recipe pages. Each recipe page follows a consistent structure and focuses on correct HTML semantics rather than styling.

## Skills Demonstrated

By completing this project, I demonstrated the ability to:

* Write semantic HTML using proper boilerplate structure
* Create and link multiple HTML pages
* Use headings, paragraphs, lists, images, and links correctly
* Organize files and folders in a clean project structure
* Deploy a static website using GitHub Pages
